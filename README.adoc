Aspirationally, it is a set of low-level helpers
to simplify working with Git LFS via Isomorphic Git.

As of 0.1.0, support is limited to:

- `readPointer({ dir, gitdir, content })`
+
where `dir`, `gitdir` behavior mimics that of Isomorphic Git,
and `content` is a `Buffer`.


- `downloadBlobFromPointer({ http, headers, url }, lfsPointer)`
+
where `http` is an `HttpClient` as supported by Isomorphic Git,
URL is repository URL
and pointer is an object returned by `readPointer()`.

- `populateCache(workDir, ref?)`
+
where `workDir` is a path to working directory,
and `ref` should probably be left at the default `"HEAD"`.
